to do:
1) Introduction - Alex
- Data origins: Either citation, or exlanation on how you created the data.
- Used in scientific works? Google scholar (search for citations of the original publication).
- What did others find out?
-  State the problem. Why is the problem interesting? That is the thing to predict
(with reasoning).
2) Data - Vlad and Alex
- Plots - Vlad
- Motivation - Alex
3) Method
- Describe all steps of the classification evaluation: - Vlad
- A few words on preliminary tests performed. -?
- Parameters that are studied: For these, there is a graph / an extra performance
measure. - Vlad
- Order of experiments
- - KNN, LDA, QDA, Naive Bayes - Vlad
- - Linear regression (SVD? Ordinary?) - don't forget to plot a graph - Alex
- - Feature engineering - Vlad
- - Outliers, Cross validation, Resampling - Alex
- - Clustering - Vlad
- Selection of meaningfull performance measures: Confusion matrices, ROC, classwise averaged classification rates... - Vlad
4) Results and discussion
- What do we learn from the results? - Vlad and Alex
